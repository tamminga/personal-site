I am an Associate Professor of [Linguistics](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/), where I direct the [Language Variation and Cognition Lab](https://tammingalab.github.io/). I am an Associate Editor at [Language](https://languagelsa.org/index.php/language) and the Associate Director of Outreach at [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/), Penn's hub for the integrative study of the mind. I am also affiliated with three MindCORE initiatives: the [Social and Behavioral Sciences Initiative](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-sbsi/), the [Social and Cultural Evolution Working Group](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/scew/), and [Integrated Language Sciences and Technology](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/langscience/).
